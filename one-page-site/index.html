                            <p>Linkin Park is an American rock band from
                                Agoura Hills, California. The band's current
                                lineup comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist Mike Shinoda,
                                lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell, turntablist/keyboardist
                                Joe Hahn and drummer Rob Bourdon, all of whom are founding members.
                                Vocalists Mark Wakefield and Chester Bennington and bassist Kyle Christner
                                are former members of the band.</p>
                            <p>Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with its debut studio
                                album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which was certified diamond by the RIAA in 2005,
                                and multi-platinum in several other countries. Its second album, Meteora (2003),
                                continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and
                                was followed by extensive touring and charity work. Having adapted nu metal and
                                rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in its first two albums,
                                the band explored other genres on its third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007).</p>
                            The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third-best debut week of any album that year.
                            <p>Linkin Park continued to explore a wider variation of musical types in its fourth album,
                            A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band's fifth album,
                            Living Things (2012), combined musical elements from all of its previous records. Its sixth album,
                            The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, and its seventh album, One More Light (2017),
                                was a more electronic and pop-oriented record.</p>
