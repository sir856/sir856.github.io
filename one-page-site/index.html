                <div class="card-content" id="about">
                    <p>Linkin Park is an American rock band from
                        Agoura Hills, California. The band's current
                        lineup comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist Mike Shinoda,
                        lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell, turntablist/keyboardist
                        Joe Hahn and drummer Rob Bourdon, all of whom are founding members.
                        Vocalists Mark Wakefield and Chester Bennington and bassist Kyle Christner
                        are former members of the band.
                        <br><br>Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with its debut studio
                        album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which was certified diamond by the RIAA in 2005,
                        and multi-platinum in several other countries. Its second album, Meteora (2003),
                        continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and
                        was followed by extensive touring and charity work. Having adapted nu metal and
                        rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in its first two albums,
                        the band explored other genres on its third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007).
                        The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third-best debut week of any album that year.
                        <br><br>Linkin Park continued to explore a wider variation of musical types in its fourth album,
                        A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band's fifth album,
                        Living Things (2012), combined musical elements from all of its previous records. Its sixth album,
                        The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, and its seventh album, One More Light (2017),
                        was a more electronic and pop-oriented record.</p>

                <p>
                    Linkin Park released Hybrid Theory on October 24, 2000. The album, which represented half a decade's
                    worth of the band's work, was edited by Don Gilmore.[21] Hybrid Theory was a massive commercial success;
                    it sold more than 4.8 million copies during its debut year, earning it the status of best-selling album
                    of 2001, while singles such as "Crawling" and "One Step Closer" established themselves as staples among
                    alternative rock radio play lists during the year.[24] Additionally, other singles from the album were
                    featured in films such as Dracula 2000, Little Nicky, and Valentine.[24] Hybrid Theory won a Grammy Award
                    for Best Hard Rock Performance for the song "Crawling" and was nominated for two other Grammy Awards: Best
                    New Artist and Best Rock Album.[34] MTV awarded the band their Best Rock Video and Best Direction awards for
                    "In the End".[21] Through the winning of the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance, Hybrid Theory's overall
                    success had catapulted the band into mainstream success.

                <p>In an interview with Fuse, Shinoda confirmed that Linkin Park had begun recording their sixth studio album in May 2013.
                    The band released the first single from their upcoming album, titled, "Guilty All the Same" on March 6, 2014 through Shazam.
                    The single was later released on the following day by Warner Bros. Records and debut at No. 28 on the US Billboard Rock
                    Airplay charts before peaking at No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock charts in the following weeks. Shortly after the single's
                    release, the band revealed their sixth album would be titled The Hunting Party. The album was produced by Shinoda
                    and Delson, who wanted to explore musical elements from Hybrid Theory and the band's earlier material. Shinoda commented
                    the album is a "90s style of rock record". He elaborated, "It's a rock record. It's loud and it's rock, but not in the
                    sense of what you've heard before, which is more like '90s hardcore-punk-thrash.' The album includes musical
                    contributions from rapper Rakim, Page Hamilton of Helmet, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, and Daron Malakian
                    of System of a Down. The Hunting Party was released on June 13, 2014, in most countries, and later released in the
                    United States on June 17.</p>

                <h5 class="center-align">Meteora</h5>
                <p>Following the success of Hybrid Theory and Reanimation, Linkin Park spent a significant amount of time touring around
                    the United States. The band members began to work on new material amidst its saturated schedule, spending a sliver
                    of their free time in their tour bus' studio. The band officially announced the production of a new studio album in
                    December 2002, revealing its new work was inspired by the rocky region of Meteora in Greece, where numerous monasteries
                    have been built on top of the rocks. Meteora features a mixture of the band's nu metal and rap metal style with newer
                    innovative effects, including the induction of a shakuhachi (a Japanese flute made of bamboo) and other instruments.
                    Linkin Park's second album debuted on March 25, 2003 and instantly earned worldwide recognition, going to No. 1 in the
                    US and UK, and No. 2 in Australia.</p>
